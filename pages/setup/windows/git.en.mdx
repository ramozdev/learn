# Git

Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to files and collaborate with other developers.

## Installation

Open a terminal and execute the following command to see the git version installed in your system:

```bash copy
git -v
```

If you do not have `git` installed, install it using the following command:

```bash copy
sudo apt-get install git
```

Once the installation has finished, open a new terminal and verify that `git` was installed.

If you are unable to install `git` following these steps, refer to the [git documentation](https://git-scm.com/download/linux).

## GitHub

Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/signup) to store your code in the cloud.

## Setup

Every time you make a commit in git, you need to provide your name and email address. This is so that git can track who made the commit. You can set this up globally on your computer.

Fill in and execute the following commands with the same display name and primary email you set in your github account.

```bash copy
git config --global user.name “[firstname lastname]”
```

```bash copy
git config --global user.email “[valid email]”
```

Now you have set up git on your computer. You will learn how to use git in the another section.
