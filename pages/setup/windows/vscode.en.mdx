# Visual Studio Code

## Download

Go to [code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and download the installer for Windows.

## Installation

Open the file that you just downloaded and follow the installation guide.

## Setup

Open Visual Studio Code and press `ctrl+O` or click on the `Open...` button.

You will be asked to select a folder to open. I suggest you create a new folder to store all the files you write to learn front-end development. Choose a name relevant to web development. I called mine `dev`.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  By convention, files and folders should be named using only lowercase characters and replacing all
  spaces with a hyphen/dash `-`, unless there is a requirement to do otherwise.
</Callout>

You may also create the folder from your operating system then drag and drop it into the editor section of VSCode to open the folder.

Once you open the directory/folder, you will see the name of your folder in the top left panel under "Explorer".

## UI

On the left side you have the activity bar. By default it has the following tabs from top to bottom:

1. Explorer: See all the files and folders in the current working directory
2. Search: To search and replace text
3. Source control: Manage and execute git commands using VSCode.
4. Run and Debug: Execute programs and debug problems
5. Extensions: Manage extensions

6. Accounts: Manage your accounts connected to VSCode
7. Settings: Manage VSCode settings

On the top right corner you have buttons to customize your layout.

Use them to hide things when you don't need them. For example, hide the panel where the terminal lives to have more vertical screen space to write code.

## Command Pallete

Press `ctrl+shift+P` or `F1` to open the command pallete from here you can execute commands that affect the code or change the way VSCode works.

## Terminal

Press `` ctrl+` `` to open the integraded terminal.

## Intellisense

Intellisense tries to predict what you are going to write and displays suggestions as you type.

## New file

Search for `Create: New File` in the command pallete or use your cursor to press the add file icon next to the name of the folder you have opened in the explorer tab. Name the file `test.js`.

You can also create files in your operating system then drag and drop the file into the explorer section (left side) to add the file to the current folder.

Open `test.js` and type `console.log("Hello World!"){:js}`. You will notice that as you type this, the intellisense opens a window below the cursor with a few suggestions and as you get closer to the word console, the suggestions gets more accurrate.

Navigate the suggestions using the arrow keys in your keyboard or use your mouse to select a suggestion.

## Auto-Save

Open the command pallete and type `settings UI`, you will see an option that says open `Preferences: Open Settings (UI)`, press enter or click on it.

Once in the settings search for `auto save` and change the `Files: Auto Save` setting from `off (default)` to `onWindowChange`. This will cause all files to save automatically when you focus on another window, like your browser.

This is just a personal, suggestion. Feel free to change the settings in any way you want.

## Live Server

You will learn HTML first, so to get started, open the extensions tab on the activity bar.

Search for the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension and install it.

Live server creates a local server that allows to see the output of the code we write in the brwoser.

## Zoom

Use `ctrl+-` to zoom out and `ctrl+=` to zoom in

## Customizing

To change the theme in VSCode open up the command pallete, and search for `Preferences: Color Theme`. Select a theme and press enter.

I use the [One Hunter Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RaillyHugo.one-hunter) which you can install from the extensions tab.

## Test

To test that everything is working create a new file called `index.html`. and paste the following code into it.

```html copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Hello World!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    This is a website!
  </body>
</html>
```

Save the file and right click on it to `Open With Live Server [CmdL CmdO]`. A new tab should open in your browser on `http://127.0.0.1:5500/` or `http://localhost:5500/`.
