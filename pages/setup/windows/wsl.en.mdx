# Windows Linux Subsystem

Windows works differently from MacOS and Linux when it comes to command line interfaces. As a front-end developer it is easier to use linux based command line interfaces and for this purpose you can use the Windows Linux Subsystem (WSL).

## Installation

Press `Windows + r`, type `cmd` and press enter to open the Windows command prompt.

Type and execute the following command to install the WSL with the Ubuntu Linux distribution

```bash
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

Once finished, restart your computer.

Open VSCode and install the [WSL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl).

Open the command pallete `Ctrl + Shift + P` and select `Developer: Reload Window` to reload VSCode.

Open the command pallete again and select `WSL: New WSL Window`. This will open a new VSCode window in a new context. When you press `Ctrl + J` to open the panel, you will see that the terminal is now a Linux terminal.

## Setup

Setup you Linux user and password. You can use the same credentials as your Windows user.

## Update

To update your Linux distribution, open the terminal and type the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Install Node.js using nvm

To install Node.js, we will use [nvm]() which is a Node.js version manager. This will allow you to install multiple versions of Node.js and switch between them.

Open the terminal and type the following commands:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
```

```bash
nvm install node
```

## Install Git

First, check if Git is already installed by typing the following command:

```bash
git --version
```

If you get an error, you need to install Git. Type the following command to install Git:

```bash
sudo apt install git
```

Now you are ready to use VSCode on Windows with a Linux terminal.
