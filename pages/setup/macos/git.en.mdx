# Git

Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to files and collaborate with other developers.

## Installation

Open a terminal and execute the following command to see the git version installed in your system:

```bash copy
git -v
```

If you do not have `git` installed, MacOS will ask you if you want to download and install the `Xcode Command Line Tools`, which includes git.

Proceed to install `Xcode Command Line Tools` and close the terminal once it has finished.

Open a new terminal and verify that `git` was installed.

If you are unable to install `git` following these steps, refer to the [git documentation](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).

## GitHub

Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/signup). To store your code in the cloud.

## Setup

Every time you make a commit in git, you need to provide your name and email address. This is so that git can track who made the commit.

To set this up globally on your computer, fill in and execute the following commands with the same display name and primary email you set in your github account.

```bash copy
git config --global user.name “[firstname lastname]”
```

```bash copy
git config --global user.email “[valid email]”
```

Now you have set up git on your computer. You will learn how to use git in the another section.
