# Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a code editor that makes writing code easier.

## Installation

Go to [code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and download the installer for MacOS.

Open the installer and follow the installation guide.

## Setup

Open Visual Studio Code and press `cmd+O` or click on the `Open...` button and open your `web` directory.

You may also drag and drop it into the editor section of VSCode to open it.

Once you open the directory/folder, you will see the name of your folder in the top left panel under "Explorer".

## UI

On the left side you have the activity bar. This is where you can access the different features of VSCode. The default features are:

1. Explorer: See all the files and folders in the current working directory
2. Search: Search and replace text
3. Source control: Execute git commands using a graphical user interface and see the status of your git repository
4. Run and Debug: Execute programs and debug problems
5. Extensions: Manage extensions

6. Accounts: Manage your accounts connected to VSCode
7. Settings: Manage VSCode settings

On the top right corner you have buttons to customize your layout.

Use them to hide things when you don't need them. For example, hide the panel where the integrated terminal lives to have more vertical screen space to write code.

## Command Pallete

Press `command shift P` or `F1` to open the command pallete. This is where you can search for commands and execute them.

## Terminal

Press `` cmd ` `` to open the integraded terminal.

## Intellisense

Intellisense tries to predict what you are going to write and displays suggestions as you type.

## New file

Search for `Create: New File` in the command pallete or use your cursor to press the add file icon next to the name of the folder you have opened in the explorer tab. Name the file `test.js`.

You can also create files in your operating system then drag and drop the file into the explorer section (left side) to add the file to the current folder.

Open `test.js` and type `console.log("Hello World!"){:js}`. You will notice that as you type this, the intellisense opens a window below the cursor with a few suggestions and as you get closer to the word console, the suggestions gets more accurrate.

Navigate the suggestions using the arrow keys in your keyboard or use your mouse to select a suggestion.

## Auto-Save

Open the command pallete and type `settings UI`, you will see an option that says open `Preferences: Open Settings (UI)`, press enter or click on it.

Once in the settings search for `auto save` and change the `Files: Auto Save` setting from `off (default)` to `onWindowChange`. This will cause all files to save automatically when you focus on another window, like your browser.

This is just a personal, suggestion. Feel free to change the settings in any way you want.

## Live Server

You will learn HTML first, so to get started, open the extensions tab on the activity bar.

Search for the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension and install it.

Live server creates a local server that allows to see the output of the code we write in the brwoser.

## Zoom

Use `command -` to zoom out and `command =` to zoom in

## Customizing

To change the theme in VSCode open up the command pallete, and search for `Preferences: Color Theme`. Select a theme and press enter.

I use the [One Hunter Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RaillyHugo.one-hunter) which you can install from the extensions tab.

## Test

To test that everything is working create a new file called `index.html` and paste the following code into it.

```html copy filename="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Hello World!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    This is a website!
  </body>
</html>
```

Save the file and right click on it to `Open With Live Server [CmdL CmdO]`. A new tab should open in your browser on `http://127.0.0.1:5500/` or `http://localhost:5500/`.
