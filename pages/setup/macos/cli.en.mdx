# Terminal / Command Line Interface (CLI)

The terminal is a text-based interface to the operating system. We use the terminal in front-end development to install software, create files, run local servers to preview our websites, amongst other things.

## Start

Press `command Space` to open the spotlight and search for `terminal`. Select the terminal application.

## Commands

A window will open with a prompt similar to this:

```bash
username@machine ~ %
```

The first goal is to create a directory called `web`, where the code for all your projects will be stored.

First, run the `pwd` command to know the path of our current working directory. In other words, we want to know what "folder" the terminal is currently at.

Type `pwd` and press enter.

```bash copy
pwd
```

Expect a path of the form `/Users/username`. In MacOS, this is the home directory.

Now use the `ls` command to see the content of the current directory.

```bash copy
ls
```

Expect a list of directories and files:

```
Applications    Downloads   Music       Desktop
Library         Pictures    Documents   Movies
Public
```

Create a new directory called `web` using the `mkdir` command where we are going to store the code for all of our projects.

```bash copy
mkdir web
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  By convention, files and folders should be named using only lowercase characters and replacing all
  spaces with a hyphen/dash `-`, unless there is a requirement to do otherwise.
</Callout>

Execute `ls` again, to confirm that the `web` directory was created.

```bash
$ ls
Applications    Downloads   Music       Desktop
Library         Pictures    Documents   Movies
Public          web
```

Navigate to `web` using the change directory `cd` command.

```bash copy
cd web
```

To ensure you moved correctly, check the path to the current directory again, using `pwd`.

```bash copy
pwd
```

You should get a path of the form:

```
/Users/username/web
```

To go back, you must use the `..` syntax which indicates the parent directory of the current working directory. For example, `cd ..` will take you to `/Users/username`

```bash copy
cd ..
```

```bash
pwd
/Users/username
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If you ever get an error executing a command in the terminal, check that you spelled everything
  correctly, **including spaces**. `cd..` is a different command from `cd ..`. The former will throw
  an error because it does not include a space after the `cd` command.
</Callout>

## Manual

To see all the options available for a command, preceed the command by `man` and press enter, for example, `man ls` will show the manual for the `ls` command.

Press `q` to exit the manual.
