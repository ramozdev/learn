# Node.js

Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

## Check Your Node.js Version

Open a terminal and execute the following command to see the Node.js version installed in your computer:

```bash
node -v
```

If you do not have Node.js installed, you will see an error message similar to the following:

```bash
zsh: command not found: node
```

If you have Node.js installed, you will see the version number, for example:

```bash
v18.14.0
```

You should have the LTS version of Node.js installed. If you have a different version, you can download the LTS version from [nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Installation

Go to [nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download the Node.js installer for MacOS.

Run the installer and follow the installation guide.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  You must allow the installer access to your file system (Downloads) directory because the
  installer will download additional data to complete the installation.
</Callout>

If you denied access to you file system go to `settings > privacy and security > files and Folders` and allow the installer, then run the installer again.

## Verify Installation

Execute the following command to see the Node.js version installed in your computer:

```bash
node -v
```

When you install Node.js, it also installs the Node Package Manager (npm). You can verify that npm is installed by running the following command:

```bash
npm -v
```

If you have npm installed, you will see the version number, for example:

```bash
9.2.0
```
