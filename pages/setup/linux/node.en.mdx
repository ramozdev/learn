# Node.js

Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

## Check Your Node.js Version

Open a terminal and execute the following command to see the Node.js version installed in your computer:

```bash copy
node -v
```

If you do not have Node.js installed, you will see an error message similar to the following:

```bash
zsh: command not found: node
```

If you have Node.js installed, you will see the version number, for example:

```bash
v18.14.0
```

You should have the LTS version of Node.js installed. Check what the LTS version of node currently is on [nodejs.org/en/download](nodejs.org/en/download).

## Installation

Go to [snapcraft.io/node](https://snapcraft.io/node) (Debian/Ubuntu) and install Node.js.

If you are using a different Linux distribution, go to [nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system.

## Verify Installation

Execute the following command to see the Node.js version installed in your computer:

```bash copy
node -v
```

When you install Node.js, it also installs the Node Package Manager (npm). You can verify that npm is installed by running the following command:

```bash copy
npm -v
```

If you have npm installed, you will see the version number, for example:

```bash
9.2.0
```
