# Image and Multimedia

## \<audio\>: Embed Audio

Used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the `src` attribute or the source element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the containing element for text that is displayed when the browser does not support the audio element.

```html copy
<audio controls>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
  <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
</audio>
```

## \<img\>: Image Embed

Used to embed an image in an HTML page. Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The `<img>` tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

```html copy
<img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5397/rhino.jpg" alt="Rhino" />
```

## \<track\>: Embed Text Track

## \<video\>: Video Embed

Used to embed video content in documents. It may contain one or more video sources, represented using the `src` attribute or the source element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the containing element for text that is displayed when the browser does not support the video element.

```html copy
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg" />
</video>
```
