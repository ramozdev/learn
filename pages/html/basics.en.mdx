# Basics

## Your First HTML Document

Create a new folder and open it in VSCode. Then create a new file called `index.html`.

First, add the required `<!DOCTYPE html>{:html}` declaration to tell the browser that this is an HTML5 document.

```html copy filename="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  HTML is not a case sensitive language. You can use uppercase or lowercase letters. However, by
  convention we use lowercase letters. The `DOCTYPE` declaration is an exception.
</Callout>

Now, define the structure of the document using HTML elements, also known as tags. First include `<html>{:html}`. This is the root element of the document. All other elements must be inside of it.

```html copy filename="index.html" {2}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en"></html>
```

![HTML Element](public/html/element-en.png)

Most HTML elements have three parts:

- Opening tag: The name of the element surrounded by `<>`. Example: `<div>`
- Content: The content can be text or another HTML element
- Closing tag: The name of the element surrounded by `<>`, with a forward slash before the name of the element `</>`. Example: `</div>`

HTML elements can also have attributes which are written inside the opening tag.

```html
<html lang="en"></html>
```

For the previous example, `lang{:html}` is an attribute and `"en"{:html}` is the value for such attribute. The `lang{:html}` attribute specifies the website's language. Here we are setting the language to English `en`.

There are also self-closing tags. These do not have content or a closing tag. The complete HTML element is the name of the element surrounded by `<>`, with an optional slash `/` before the less than sign `>`.

```html copy
<input type="text" name="city" />
```

## Metadata and Content

Add the `<head>{:html}` and `<body>{:html}` tags inside `<html>{:html}`.

```html copy filename="index.html" {3-4}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head></head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

The `<head>{:html}` contains all the metadata for the document. The `<body>{:html}` contains all the content that will be displayed in the browser.

Start by adding `<meta>{:html}` tags inside the `<head>{:html}`, to declare metadata for the HTML document.

```html showLineNumbers copy filename="index.html" {4-6, 9-10}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Your First HTML Document</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

    <!-- Optional -->
    <meta name="description" content="Welcome to my first ever website!" />
    <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

The `<title>{:html}` is used to specify the title of the document. This is what will be displayed in the browser's tab. The `charset{:html}` attribute of the `<meta>{:html}` tag is used to specify the character set of the document. The `name` attribute of a `<meta>{:html}` tag is used to specify the name of the metadata. In the example is used to specify the desired viewport settings and the description of the document.

The `<link>{:html}` tag is used to specify the location of a resource. In this case we are specifying the location of the favicon. The favicon is the small icon that is displayed in the browser's tab.

Now, start adding content by adding a `<main>{:html}` tag inside the `<body>{:html}`.

```html showLineNumbers copy filename="index.html" {13}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Your First HTML Document</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta name="description" content="Welcome to my first ever website!" />

    <!-- Optional -->
    <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>Hello World!</main>
  </body>
</html>
```

From this point forward you will be mostly working inside the `<body>{:html}` because the rest of the document is automatically generated or abstracted in some way by Next.js and other JavaScript frameworks you will be using as a Front-End Engineer.

## Setup a playground

1. Install [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VSCode.

2. Create an `index.html` file anywhere in your file system, and paste the code from the `hello world` example.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  You must save the file before you run the server.
</Callout>

3. Right click on the document and select `Open With Live Server`.

A new tab will automatically open in your default browser with the document you just created. Any changes you make will be applied after you save the file.
