# Basics

CSS is used to style elements in a browser.

## Box Model

The box model is the foundation of CSS. It is the way that the browser calculates the size of elements and how they are displayed on the page.

The box model is made up of the following parts in order from the inside out:

- Content
- Padding
- Border
- Margin

## Selectors

Selectors are used to target elements in the DOM.

## The cascade

The cascade is the way that CSS rules are applied to elements. It is the process of combining multiple CSS rules and declarations together to determine the final styles applied to an element.

## Specificity

Specificity is the way that the browser determines which CSS rule is the most relevant to an element. It is used to resolve conflicts between CSS rules and declarations with the same selector when more than one rule could apply to the same element.

## Inheritance

Inheritance is the way that some CSS properties are inherited by child elements. If a property is inherited, it will be applied to an element based on the value of that property for its parent element.

## Color

## Sizing Units

## Layout

## Flexbox

Flexbox is a layout mode that makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

## Grid

Grid is a layout mode that makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.
