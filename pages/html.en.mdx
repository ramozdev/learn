# HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines the meaning and structure of a website. HyperText refers to the fact that websites usually contain links to navigate the content inside such website or point to external websites.

HTML is the most fundamental part of a website. You can publish a website on the World Wide Web using only HTML. It would be an archaic and ugly one, but a website nonetheless. To make websites prettier we use CSS and to add functionality we use JavaScript. These two technologies compliment the HTML to give website a modern look and functionality.

An HTML tag starts with `<`, followed by the tag name and ends with `>`. An example tag is `<div>`. HTML is case insensitive, but by convention, tag names are written in lowercase.

- Opening tag: Starts with `<`, followed by the tag name, ends with `>`
- Closing tag: Starts with `</`, followed by the tag name, ends with `>`

Self-closing tag: A tag which does not accept content. This tag does not have a closing tag. For example, `<input/>`, is a self closing tag.
